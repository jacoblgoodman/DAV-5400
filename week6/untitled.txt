1. What proportion of diamonds are between .30 and 1.08 carats?
2. How mab bny of the diamonds have equal x and y dimensions?
3. How many of the diamonds have a carat less than the mean carat value?
4. How many diamonds have a Premium cut or better? Note that the possible values for the quality of a cut are
ranked in ascending order as follows: Fair / Good / Very Good / Premium / Ideal
5. Which diamond has the highest price per carat? What is its value?
6. Make a bar plot of the ‘cut’ data. What does it tell us about the frequencies of the individual cut values within
the data set?
7. Make boxplots of the diamond price for each cut and discuss any conclusions you can draw from the appearance
of the boxplots.
8. Make histograms of the length, width, depth, and total depth attributes and discuss any conclusions you can
draw from the shape of the resulting distributions.
9. Make a scatter plot of price vs. carat. What can we say about the relationship between those two attributes?
