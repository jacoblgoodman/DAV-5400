    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I plan to look at Citibike ridership data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Citibike bike-share program which operates as a public-private partnership in Manhattan, Brooklyn Queens, and Jersey city as well in the 6 other programs run in other cities by Citibike's Parent organization [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/). The program represents not only an expansion of mobility to NY city residents but also a significant opportunity from a sociological perspective and potentially a fiscal one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2019 Citibike averaged 43,604 rides a day and brought in a gross revenue of approx. $4,737,225.81\n",
    "<cite href='https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/nyc/March-2019-Citi-Bike-Monthly-Report.pdf?mtime=20190409100608'>(Citibike march monthly report 2019)</cite>.  There are opportunities for competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "What affects ridership? For this analysis we will look at one potential factor: weather. The results of this analysis could potentially be utilized by other transportation services (such as ride shares) to identify potential marketing opportunities to capture (or nudge)  bike-share users to rideshare. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does weather affect ridership of the Citi bike system? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why we would want to know how much of an effect weather has on ridership depending on the entity asking the question and the type of weather in question. We will focus on two different reasons for this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seasonal bikeshare (Citibike motivate)  :   \n",
    "\n",
    "​\tIf seasonal weather changes are going to make predictable changes to my ridership, can I alter my redistribution program (the non organic moving around of bicycles) to meet demand?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weather events competitor program:   \n",
    "\n",
    "​\tCan I take advantage of extreme weather events (for example rain) or weather conditions near or at identified thresholds that alter behavior to nudge city bike users to my service. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data to be Used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Citi bike Ridership data:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Source* : <https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data>\n",
    "\n",
    "*process*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Citibike publishes trip data in monthly csv documents that can be downloaded. The data is at the grain of a trip with start/end along with information about the rider (age, gender, and customer type).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical weather data: \n",
    "\n",
    "Two sources of historical weather data will be pursued:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scraping from [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Data from the Newark Liberty International weather station appears to be accessible for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Data conforms to the following syntax: https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ny/new-york-city/KEWR/date/{date: yyyy-m-d}\n",
    "\n",
    "   Hourly readings are present in a html table id = 'history-observation-table'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. API via [darksky](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/sources)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Dark sky provides a comprehensive and cost effective ($0.0001 per call) API  which returns both observed and forecast values for every hour of requested day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will download Citibike data as .csv (comma separated values) files this data will be in several files so I will upload them into a data base to bind them together. I will then acquire weather data for the same time period as my Citbike data and store that in a .csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have my data I will need to aggregate the data to be at the same grain (day) and perform EDA (exploratory data analysis) to visualize and verify the data, make any necessary modifications (such as replacing null values) and tidy before the final analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final analysis, I will generate some summary information to help explain the data, ridership statistics by day of the week and by month in particular. I will then create visualizations to see how ridership is related to two types of weather: temperature and weather events (ie rain, snow, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with temperature, and weather events as predictor variables we will see how well they can be utilized to predict daily ridership through a  regression model either poisson or negative bionmial depending on the distribution of the data. "
