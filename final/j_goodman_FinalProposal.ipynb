    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> *This section should provide some context for the basis of the research questions you plan to answer without actually describing the research questions themselves. For example, if your research questions are focused on a health related issue, you might provide a brief summary of how many people are affected by that issue each year either regionally, nationally or globally, including any infection rate or mortality statistics you were able to gather. Basically, in the Introduction you are trying to make the reader understand why the research questions you are going to propose are relevant and should be of interest to them.*\n",

    "For this project I plan to look at Citibike ridership data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Citibike bike-share program which operates as a public-private partnership in Manhattan, Brooklyn Queens, and Jersey city as well in the 6 other programs run in other city's by Citibike's Parent organization [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/). The program represents not only an expansion of mobility to NY city residents but also a significant opportunity from a sociological perspective and potentially a fiscal one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In march 2019 Citibike averaged 43,604 rides a day and brought in a gross revenue of approx. $4,737,225.81\n",
    "<cite href='https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/nyc/March-2019-Citi-Bike-Monthly-Report.pdf?mtime=20190409100608'>(Citibike march monthly report 2019)</cite>.  There are opportunities  for competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "What affects ridership? For this analysis we will look at one potential factor: weather. The results of this analysis could potentially be utilized by other transportation services (such as ride shares) to identify potential marketing opportunities to capture (or nudge)  Bike-share  users to rideshare. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a single succinct sentence that describes each of your research questions. Then provide a paragraph or two explaining how the results of your research might be used/implemented in the \"real world\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does weather effect ridership of the Citi bike system? \n",
    "\n",
    "Their are several reasons why we would want to know how much of an effect weather has on ridership. depending on the entity asking the question and the type of weather in question. we will focus on 2 for this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seasonal bikeshare(Citibike motivate)  :   \n",
    "\n",
    "​\tif seasonal weather changes are going to make predictable changes to my ridership can I alter my Redistribution program (the non organic moving around of bicycles) to either meet demand or do to reduced need. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weather events Competitor program:   \n",
    "\n",
    "​\tcan I take advantage of extreme weather events (for example rain) or weather conditions near or at identified thresholds that alter behavior to nudge city bike users to my service. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data to be Used\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Clearly identify the sources of your data and explain the methods you will use to collect the data from those sources, e.g., \"Data from this source will be loaded into an SQL database..\" or \"Data will need to be collected from this source via scraping of a web page..\", etc.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Citi bike Ridership data:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Source* : <https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data>\n",
    "\n",
    "*process*:\n",
    "\n",
    "​\tThe amount of data needed will necessitate storage  this will be accomplished via a MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical weather data: \n",
    "\n",
    "two sources of historical weather data will be pursued:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. scraping from [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Data from the Newark Liberty International weather station appears to be accessible for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "   data conforms to the following syntax https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ny/new-york-city/KEWR/date/{date: yyyy-m-d}\n",
    "\n",
    "   hourly reading are present in a html table id = 'history-observation-table'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. API via [darksky](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/sources)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Dark sky provides a comprehensive and cost effective ($0.0001 per call ) API  which returns both observed and forecast values for every hour of requested day\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "> Explain how you plan to manage the data you are collecting: e.g., will you be storing it within some sort of database, etc.? Explain what types of statistical analysis you plan to utilize to help answer your research questions. Explain any graphics you plan to generate to help answer you research questions, e.g., \"..we will attempt to construct geoplots that will show how xxxxxx varies between counties within the state of Nevada..\", etc. The reader should come away with a clear understanding of how you plan to proceed with your work. Keep in mind that since this is a proposal, you need to be able to convince the reader that your proposed project is: a) realistic; and b) feasible within the time alloted for the project.\n",

    "Data acquisition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Citi bike data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. download as csv\n",
    "2. upload to mysql \n",
    "\n",

    "1. acquire via web scrape or api\n",
    "2. store as csv file \n",

    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "after conducting EDA and performing any needed tidying we will attempt to answer our research question via the following process.\n",
    "\n",
    "summary statistics of ridership:\n",
    "By day of the week \n",
    "By month\n",

    "   2. scatterplot - daily high temp vs number of  daily riders \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "   regression with high temperature as the predictor variable  \n",
    "\n",
    "**weather events:**\n",
